Intro to Redux
==============

## Objectives

- [ ] What is Redux?
- [ ] Why Redux?
- [ ] Do I really have to use Redux?
- [ ] Prove it to you.
- [ ] How do I learn Redux?


Pain Points
- passing state
- routing
- having objects that need to be mapped to render things
- console logging (when and where)
- debuggers are liars

## Outline

- [ ] Recap what we know about React
- [ ] What "problems" have you run into in React?
- [ ] Enter Redux
  - [ ] What?
  - [ ] Why?
  - [ ] How?
- [ ] Do I really have to?
- [ ] Prove it to me.
- [ ] FAQ / Q&A

## Vocabulary

My potentially controversial take:

> Redux is as much a test of your English skills as it is a test of your JavaScript skills.

## Lecture Notes

Redux **will** test your JavaScript knowledge to the **MAX**!!!

### React Recap

**Pain Points**

- When state becomes too big and shared, there's too much lifting & too much refactoring.

Much like what _Fun Fun Functions_ said about Composition over Inheritance:

- you've set your `state`
- app is nicely structured and all good
- but then the boss comes over and says, "let's add this feature!"
- this feature necessitates adding `state` somewhere that needs either:
  - lots of passing around
  - refactoring and moving state around (lifting up, etc.)
- So what are you to do?

Redux. That's what.

- That's when Redux helps the most.
- React == easy and fast to setup, but becomes a pain when it becomes too heavy.
- Redux == slow to setup (boilerplate), but makes to much easier to scale apps.

### Redux Overview

[See slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1c1Ycvl3-3eMr3Eq-uAn4yU7HHjGuo_eU0PLevAEHUIg/edit?usp=sharing).

**Key Points**

- What does Redux solve.
- Single Source of Truth: Store
- Read and Writing to the Store
- Pure Functions: Reducers
- Unidirectional Flow
- Common Hurdles of Redux

Catchy phrase I learned from another instructor that might help you understand redux:

> Data down actions up that is how we like to redux.
